      <div class="history-list">
        <ul>
          <li>Lady Triệu was a native of Nông Cống district</li>
          <li>When Chinese state of Eastern Wu occuppied Vietnam, Lady Triệu went to the mountain and gathered a band of 1.000 followers</li>
          <li>Her brother tried to persuade her from rebelling, she told him: </li>
          <p class="blockquote quote">"I only want to ride the wind and walk the waves, slay the big whales of the Eastern sea, clean up frontiers, and save the people from drowning. Why should I imitate others, bow my head, stoop over and be a slave? Why resign myself to menial
            housework?"</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>When she went to battles, she usually wore yellow tunics and rode a war-elephant.</li>
          <li>Lady Triệu had managed to fight back the Wu forces for 5 or 6 months. Because of the lack of troops, she could not manage to fight a long war and was defeated.</li>
          <li>She fled to Bồ Điền commune and then committed suicide.</li>
        </ul>
